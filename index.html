                I'm a rising senior studying computer science at UCLA.
                I am also pursuing minors in Japanese and Math. I'm from Taiwan!<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Having essentially no experience in CS coming into UCLA, I feel like I've come so far just by learning
                from the amazing professors and peers here.
                I'm super excited to learn about operating systems, compilers, machine learning, backend technologies,
                and anything else I can get my hands on.

                Back at Amazon! I'm once again interning at the deep engine-engineering team. This year, I'm working on
                a diff tool between different releases of DLAMIs.

            </h3>
            <p>
                I interned at the AWS deep engine-engineering team this summer, working on automating the security
                patching process of Deep Learning Amazon Machine Images (DLAMIs).

                Software Intern @ Raydium Semiconductor (2022)
            </h3>
            <p> Raydium Semiconductor is a company that designs integrated circuits used in
                TV, car, and phone displays. As a
                software intern, I worked in the algorithm team and mostly focused writing a new IC simulator
                and integrating it with company code. I also worked on writing data visualization scripts in
                GNU octave and python, as well as summarizing a couple of papers on Kalman filters

            <h3>UCLA VAST Lab Undergraduate Researcher</h3>
            <p>
                My project was about qubit mapping in reconfigurable atom arrays during quantum circuit compilation.
                My main tasks included tweaking SMT solver constraints in the codebase to standardize
                the output generated by greedy and optimal quantum compiling algorithms and streamlining quantum
                compilation workflow by integrating the optimal and greedy compilers.

        <div class="experience-block">
            <h3>IEEE Pocket Racers</h3>
            <p>My second yearlong (and ongoing) project with IEEE. This project focuses on computer vision
                and machine learning. We're trying to build a car that can drive around a racetrack from images
                it "sees" from a camera! So far, we've been learning about some math behind ML and will begin to
                work on the actual car in spring quarter
            </p>

        <div class="experience-block">
            <h3>Corkboard</h3>
            <p>Corkboard is my CS 35L project, where my team built a webapp to help roommates track and manage their
                fridge space. I mainly worked on the backend side of things, including storing, updating, and deleting
                data from our firebase database, as well as the frontend logic to manage react states and display data
                queries from the database. It was my first real experience working in backend, so it was super
                rewarding!
                100% would do again.

        <div class="experience-block">
            <h3>ACM TeachLA Dev Team</h3>
            <p>I initially joined teachLA's react team to learn more about frontend development and technologies. After
                a
                quarter in the learning team, I felt that I was ready to contribute to one of teachLA's ongoing
                projects.
                Currently, I'm on the PenPals team, where we're working on developing a website that will help teach
                kids
                about coordinate systems.

            <h3>IEEE OPS</h3>
            <p>This is a yearlong project held by the IEEE club at UCLA, designed for beginners. I got to build
                circuits,
                work with Arduino, and make some cool projects like an Ipoduino and hand-following car :)
