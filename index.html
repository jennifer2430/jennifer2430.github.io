            <p>
                I'm a sophomore studying computer science and engineering at UCLA.
                I'll also be minoring in Japanese once I finish Japan 80 in spring. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I grew up in Taiwan and went to school there until I finished grade 10. I then finished
                my last two years of high school in a boarding school in Victoria, Canada. That was fun.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love what I've been learning here at UCLA. Having essentially no experience in
                CS coming in, I feel like I've come so far just by learning from the amazing professors and peers here.
                Now that I'm almost done with my lower div requirements, I'm super excited to learn about
                operating systems, compilers, machine learning, backend technologies, and anything else I can
                get my hands on.

            <h3>
                Software Intern @ Raydium Semiconductor (2022)
            </h3>
            <p>My first industry internship! Raydium Semiconductor is a company that designs integrated circuits used in
                TV, car, and phone displays. As a
                software intern, I worked in the algorithm team and mostly focused writing a new IC simulator
                and integrating it with company code, all in c. I also worked on writing data visualization scripts in
                GNU octave and python, as well as summarizing (to my best ability) a couple of papers on Kalman filters

        <h2 class="section-header">Things I Dabbled with at School</h2>
        <div class="experience-block">
            <h3>IEEE Pocket Racers</h3>
            <p>My second yearlong (and ongoing) project with IEEE. This project focuses on computer vision
                and machine learning. We're trying to build a car that can drive around a racetrack from images
                it "sees" from a camera! So far, we've been learning about some math behind ML and will begin to
                work on the actual car in spring quarter
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="experience-block">
            <h3>Corkboard</h3>
            <p>Corkboard is my CS 35L project, where my team built a webapp to help roommates track and manage their
                fridge space. I mainly worked on the backend side of things, including storing, updating, and deleting
                data from our firebase database, as well as the frontend logic to manage react states and display data
                queries from the database. It was my first real experience working in backend, so it was super
                rewarding!
                100% would do again.
            </p>

        <div class="experience-block">
            <h3>ACM TeachLA Dev Team</h3>
            <p>I initially joined teachLA's react team to learn more about frontend development and technologies. After
                a
                quarter in the learning team, I felt that I was ready to contribute to one of teachLA's ongoing
                projects.
                Currently, I'm on the PenPals team, where we're working on developing a website that will help teach
                kids
                about coordinate systems.

            <h3>IEEE OPS</h3>
            <p>This is a yearlong project held by the IEEE club at UCLA, designed for beginners. I got to build
                circuits,
                work with Arduino, and make some cool projects like an Ipoduino and hand-following car :)
